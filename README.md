# Reverse Engineering Laboratory Challenges

Welcome! This repository contains my completed laboratory challenges for the Reverse Engineering class at Faculty of Mathematics & Informatics, University of Bucharest - Master's 2nd year, Security and Applied Logic.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each laboratory challenge. Each directory contains the relevant files and documentation for that specific challenge.
